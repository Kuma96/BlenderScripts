Some useful scripts I made

Invert Bone Tail:
The bone head of the selected bone will remain in the same position, the tail will be inverted. Example (-1, -2, 3) -> (1, 2, -3)

Normalize All Weights Of All Objects:
This makes sure that the sum of the weights across all vertex groups is equal to 1 and clean the unused vertex weights for all the objects of the selected armature.

Remove Bones And Fuse Weights:
This fuses the weight of the selected bones with the weight of their parents and delete those selected bones later.

Remove Unweighted Tail Bones:
Remove unweighted bones that do not have any child bone, so they are useless.
